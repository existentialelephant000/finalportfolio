        <p>the project: How do we quantify design? Can we really say one design is "better" than 
            another, in a technical sense? Actually, the answer is yes! Using eye tracking technology,
            we tracked the time it took test subjects to complete a task given two different UIs. Both interfaces
            had the same goal — to make the a restaurant ordering page as seasmless and intuitive for the user
            as possible. After collecting the data, we performed statsitical analysis by hand to determine
            if there was a sigfigant difference between designs A and B.
        </p>
        <h1>ok... why though?</h1>
        <p> We often forget the sheer number of interfaces we interact with, and the sheer amount of time we spend
            using them. If we were to add up the amount of time wasted on websites because of confusing, suboptimal designs,
            you wouldn't be happy. Time is money, and nobody likes loosing money. If we are able to quantify the performance
            of designs, choosing the right ones becomes much easier, and thus, we can save humanity countless hours of time.
        </p>
        <p>conclusions: key takeaway — What you think might be the best design, probably isn't. It is especially easy to
            believe in a design as being superior to another. And there are principles that many scholars have accurately
            pinned down as "good design principles". But the truth lies in the data. </p>
